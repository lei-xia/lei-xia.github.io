Palacios is a new open-source VMM that enables applications executing 
in a virtualized
environment to achieve scalable high performance on large machines.
Palacios functions as a modularized extension to Kitten,
a high performance operating system being developed at Sandia
National Laboratories to support large-scale supercomputing
applications. Together, Palacios and Kitten provide a thin layer
over the hardware to support full-featured virtualized environments
alongside Kitten’s lightweight native environment. Palacios
supports existing, unmodified applications and operating
systems by using the hardware virtualization technologies in
recent AMD and Intel processors. Additionally, Palacios leverages
Kitten’s simple memory management scheme to enable
low-overhead pass-through of native devices to a virtualized
environment. We describe the design, implementation, and
integration of Palacios and Kitten. Our benchmarks show that
Palacios provides near native (within 5%), scalable performance
for virtualized environments running important parallel
applications. This new architecture provides an incremental
path for applications to use supercomputers, running specialized
lightweight host operating systems, that is not significantly
performance-compromised.

<h2 id="vnet">VNET/P: A fast virtual overlay network for high performance computing</h2>
<p>Overlay networking with a layer 2 abstraction provides a powerful model for virtualized wide-area 
distributed computing resources, including for high performance computing (HPC) on collections of 
virtual machines (VMs). With the emergence of cloud computing, it is now possible to allow VMs hosting 
tightly-coupled HPC applications to seamlessly migrate between distributed cloud resources and tightly-coupled 
supercomputing and cluster resources. However, to achieve the application performance that the tightlycoupled 
resources are capable of, it is important that the overlay network not introduce significant overhead relative 
to the native hardware.</p>

<p>To support such a model, we designed and implemented a virtual networking system that has negligible 
latency and bandwidth overheads in 1-10 Gbps networks. Our system, VNET/P, is embedded into our publicly 
available Palacios virtual machine monitor (VMM). VNET/P achieves native performance on 1 Gbps Ethernet 
networks and very high performance on 10 Gbps Ethernet networks and InfiniBand. On the latter networks, 
performance is converging to native speeds as we continue to enhance VNET/P.</p>

<h2 id="vwifi">Virtual WiFi: A virtualization approach for wireless network devices</h2>

<p> New approach to virtualization that enables wifi virtualization. One phyisical WiFi 
interface is virtualized and can be used in multiple VMs. Current approach is to virtualize 
an ethernet device inside the GuestVM. This strips all the wifi functionality. 
The new approach virtualizes complete wifi functionalities in the VM. The same Intel Wifi 
driver is used in the GuestVM as is used in the HostVM. Each VM gets its own vMAC, HostVM 
distributes packets according to vMAC, all other capabilities are directly forwarded to 
the VMs and can be set by the VMs as well. </p>

<h2 id="vpio">Virtual Passthrough I/O (VPIO): A model-based approach to improve virtualized I/O performance on commodity devices</h2>

<br>
<p>Virtual passthrough I/O (VPIO) is our proposed IO virtualization approach that 
uses a model-based method to allow virtual passthrough I/O on commodity devices.
</p>

<p>The current approaches to allow high-performance I/O in guest operating systems 
are limited. In one approach, the virtual machine provides full emulation of the 
device in order to multiplex it to each guest operating system; however, this 
requires significant overhead in the VM. To reduce the performance penalty, a 
guest might bypass the virtual machine altogether in direct-assignment I/O. 
However, this approach is less secure, since a guest could affect the memory 
of other guests or the VM itself. Some devices are multiplexed in the hardware 
and allow each guest to directly access the device while preserving security, 
but this feature is not available on commodity I/O devices, nor do these devices
currently allow migration of guests.</p>

<p>VPIO allows a guest to have direct access to the hardware for most operations and 
also allows a guest to migrate. VPIO assumes that there is a simple model of the 
device that can determine (1) whether a device is reusable, (2) whether a DMA is 
about to be initiated, and (3) what device requests are needed to update the model. 
VPIO also assumes that the device can be context-switched, that is, that the device 
can deterministically save or restore the state pertaining to a guest operating system. 
For the best performance, the goal of VPIO is to have most guest/device interactions 
complete without an exit into the VM.</p>

<p>Under VPIO, each access to the device must go through a Device Modeling Monitor (DMM). 
The purpose of DMM is twofold: (1) It saves enough state about the guest and the device 
that a guest could migrate to a new VM, and (2) it ensures that the VMM enforces proper 
security. It also keeps track of a hooked I/O list, which is a set of I/O ports that 
require VM intervention if accessed by a guest. Unhooked I/O ports may be used by the 
guest directly. The device is multiplexed by performing a context switch on the device 
(restoring the guest-specific state into the device).</p>

<p>We implemented two example models for NE2000 and RTL8139 network cards and had it running 
under QEMU. The model was under 1000 lines of code, and only a small fraction of I/Os 
(about 1 in 30) needed VM intervention. </p>
